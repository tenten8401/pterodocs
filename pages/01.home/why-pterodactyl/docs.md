|Security|Pterodactyl Panel has always, and always will, put security first. We make use of best security practices and methods. Passwords are always stored in hashed form using Bcrypt hashing. Any sensitive data is stored using `AES-256-CBC` encryption.|
|Design|We keep our design and pages simple for two reasons: your eyes and your bandwidth. Theres no need to load complex, fancy pages when a simple, clean design can accomplish the same thing.|
|Extensibility|We're open source! All of our templates are created using the `Blade Templating Engine` which allows you to fully customize every aspect of the design. We also implemented a theme changer so that you can build off our base theme with your own customizations, or even build an entirely new theme.|
|Responsiveness|Its the new key-word in today's world, but it does exist in the panel. The entire panel is mobile friendly and looks great on every screen.|
|Features|We're committed to bringing the best panel to market, and we've left no stone unturned. We're always listening to our users and implementing new features to keep things fresh.|
|Docker|We make use of docker to run all of your server processes. This keeps everything isolated from both other servers and the core system itself. Docker also allows us to implement strict resource limits and operating environments tailored to each specific game. We also leverage Alpine Linux for as many containers as possible in order to keep the size and overhead small.|
|Remote API|With support for remote requests you're sure to grow your business with Pterodactyl Panel. Our API supports server creation, deletion, management, and so much more out of the box. Pterodactyl Panel's API management is designed with security in mind and includes fine-tuned access controls including action permissions and IP controls.|
